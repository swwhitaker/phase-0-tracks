What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? 

GET - requests data 
POST - submits data

More specifically, GET requests can be cached, bookmarked, stored in history, have length limitations, and are best used only for retrieval. Only allows ASCII characters. Data is displayed in the URL.  

POST requests stand in contrast with all of the above. (see: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp) POST methods, for example, will resubmit data, and should alert the user to this fact.
