A major concept with the Unix/Linux philosophy is the assumption that the user knows what she or he is more experienced and computer literate than a typical user. (This may explain its appeal to iconoclasts and pseudoelitists ever since ;) ) 

Another aspect is that quality control is important, so development can seem complex due to the measures taken to ensure proper system development. 

Making separate programs more often than complicating single programs appears to be a key element of Unix and Linux design, so each program will "do one thing well." 

Trial, early and often seems key as well. 

The advantages of VPS hosting:

-You can give your site a dedicated server not affected by traffic to other sites on the server. 

-more control over and access to your environment

-environmentally advantageous with smaller footprint than more physical dedicated servers

-scalability; can add/rededicate more power as needed by simply altering or upgrading the container

-low barrier to entry
