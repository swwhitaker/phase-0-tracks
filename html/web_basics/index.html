<h1> Teh Kittehs
</h1>
This is just content. <p> This content is in a paragraph. That's pretty cool!</p>
<p> Well, onto the subject of kittens. I <em>love</em> the idea of kittens, and truly wish I could have some. </p> 

<p>  A few examples of why I would love to have some kittens include, in order of importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>My wife loves them</li>
<li>I love my wife</li>
<li>They are snuggly</li>
<li>They are tiny</li>
</ol>


<p> Unfortunately. I'm allergic. 
</p>
<p> Things that suck about this include, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>My wife misses out</li>
<li>We don't have any ferocious kittens to protect our home</li>
<li>There is no nascent hunter in our home to bring prey home to us stoopid hoomans</li>
<li>There is nobody to arbitrarily (even capriciously) alternate between needing our attention, being oblivious to our existence, being annoyed at said existence, and being furious at said existence </li>	
</ul>
