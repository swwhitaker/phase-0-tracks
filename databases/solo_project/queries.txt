1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

ssqlite> SELECT * FROM inventory;
1|5|$15|1
2|2|$20|2
3|7|$25|3
4|8|$30|4
5|2|$50|5
6|8|$55|6
7|12|$125|7
8|3|$250|8

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> UPDATE inventory SET price = "$395" WHERE id = 8;
sqlite> SELECT * FROM inventory;
1|5|$15|1
2|2|$20|2
3|7|$25|3
4|8|$30|4
5|2|$50|5
6|8|$55|6
7|12|$125|7
8|3|$395|8


3. Display the information in both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT * FROM inventory, sizes WHERE inventory.size = sizes.id;
1|5|$15|1|1|4x6
2|2|$20|2|2|5x7
3|7|$25|3|3|8x10
4|8|$30|4|4|8x12
5|2|$50|5|5|16x20
6|8|$55|6|6|16x24
7|12|$125|7|7|20x30
8|3|$250|8|8|24x36

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT inventory.price, sizes.size FROM inventory JOIN sizes ON inventory.size = sizes.id;
$15|4x6
$20|5x7
$25|8x10
$30|8x12
$50|16x20
$55|16x24
$125|20x30
$395|24x36


5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> DELETE FROM inventory WHERE id=3;
sqlite> DELETE FROM sizes WHERE id=3;
sqlite> SELECT inventory.price, sizes.size FROM inventory JOIN sizes ON inventory.size = sizes.id;
$15|4x6
$20|5x7
$30|8x12
$50|16x20
$55|16x24
$125|20x30
$395|24x36
